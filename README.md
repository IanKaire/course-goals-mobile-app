# Course Goals
 A basic course goals app for React Native. Here is a brief summary about it:
   1. User Interface: The app provides a user interface where users can interact with the course goals. This interface typically includes an input field for entering new goals and a list to display existing goals.

   2. Adding Goals: Users can enter a new course goal in the input field provided. Upon submitting the goal, it is added to the list of goals displayed in the app's interface. The new goal is displayed as a new item in the list.

   3. Deleting Goals: Each course goal displayed in the app's interface has a corresponding delete action associated with it. When a user clicks on a particular goal, that goal is removed from the list, effectively deleting it from the user's course goals.

   4. Data Management: The app utilizes React state to handle the course goals' data and its changes. The state stores the list of goals, and adding or deleting a goal triggers updates to the state, which, in turn, updates the app's interface to reflect the changes.

   5. Styling and Design: The React Native course goal app utilizes the StyleSheet component to make the app visually appealing and user-friendly.
